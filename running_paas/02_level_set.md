# Rule #1: IaaS != PaaS
* IaaS focus is on VM's
* PaaS focus is on Applications

.notes Important to not mix up IaaS and PaaS.  IaaS is about efficiently manage
virtual machines.  PaaS is about efficiently managing a lot of applications.
Those applications might not map 1:1 with VM's

# Rule #2: PaaS is Not A

.notes PaaS is no silver bullet. It will transform the industry in a few years,
but isn't right for all use cases

* Self-service environments
* Varied, volatile workloads
* Polyglot environments
* Standard deployments

.notes Developer experience is being defined in the hosted service space.  With
a lot of different workloads, you can overcommit resources - PaaS is a great
abstraction for that.  If you need to support a variety of languages and
capabilities in a standard way, PaaS is great.  Apps need to harness elasticity
of the cloud and a PaaS relies on standards to accomplish that.

# Rule #3: PaaS is about developers
* AND OPERATIONS!!

.notes No need for another tool to speed up development.  The industry needs
development capability and operational capability to align.
